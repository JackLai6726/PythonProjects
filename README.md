Thought process in the code

 - Choosing a word randomly from the list of words
 - As some words in the list contain '-' or ' ', add a script to choose a word that has none of those
 - Add a variable that saves the letters in a word as a set
 - Add an empty set that keeps track of what the user has guessed
 - Loop on user input, until they guess all letters
 - Or if lives run out first, display ("You dies, sorry. The word was', word)
